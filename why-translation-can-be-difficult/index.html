      <p>For example, In English, the word “plain” can take on the following meanings:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Ordinary / undecorated</u>: a plain white shirt
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Easy / simple to understand</u>: plain English
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>A level area of land</u>: great plains
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Due to polysemy, translating English into other languages is more complex than it seems. One will have to
          know which sense of the word is truly needed.</p>

        <p>For example, there are over 20 ways to saying "to get" in Italian. This is because there are multiple
          meanings of "get" that are used in English, but the Italian must use a different word for each of those
          meanings. This concept isn't that obvious, but this can give translators some trouble.</p>

        <p>At basic levels of Italian, most are taught the verb ottenere ("to get"). But which sense of the word "get"
          is really used here? Ottenere is used when something is acquired (it looks like the English word obtain). A
          different word must be used if you want "get" to take on a different meaning.</p>

        <p>In each of the following sentences "get" takes a different meaning:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Buy</u>: I need to get some bread.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Understand</u>: I get the idea.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Arrive</u>: We need to get home.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This is just one word out of many which can cause translation difficulty. One must study the context
          carefully and do not try to translate word for word, or even worse, rely on an automated translator.
          Translation done by a machine can produce very awkward and often hilarious results which make no sense at all.
          Automatic translators are only useful for giving a brief overview (the gist of what is being said) of the main
          ideas being discussed. How will a machine translator know which sense of a word is being used, especially if
          that word has many homonyms? Looking at the context (or surrounding words) is somewhat useful, but it is not
          always fool-proof. Only a human being can determine what the best translation is.</p>
