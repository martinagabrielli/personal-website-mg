      <p>Who is this translator? What does he do? And what skills should he possess?</p>

      <p>Simply put, a translator is a person who recreates a text in another language, attempting to keep a delicate
        balance between being so literal that the text sounds awkward and unnatural in the new language or being so
        free that the text has become virtually unrecognizable. A translator has to not only translate the words, but
        also the concepts. In other words, a translator unlocks the prison of language, as Ms. Lesser said, and helps
        a text break free of its limited original language, culture, and audience. This service is an unfortunately
        under-appreciated art and craft.</p>

      <p>To do all the above, a translator must have the following things: a native or near-native level of
        proficiency in both the source language (the language to be translated from) and the target language (the
        language to be translated to); the ability to thoroughly understand all that a text says and implies; and
        excellent writing and editing skills. Ideally, the translator would also have a lot of knowledge about both
        the source and target language cultures, as this affects word usage and meaning, as well as about the author
        of the original document and his style of writing.</p>

      <p>It all sounds rather formidable, certainly, but not impossible. There are, in fact, many excellent
        practitioners out there who fulfill these hefty requirements, but the tiny number of translated books
        published in the United States each year reveals the sad fact that few people take up this challenging and
        stimulating work. If only more people would join the ranks of translators and help unlock the prison of
        language.</p>
