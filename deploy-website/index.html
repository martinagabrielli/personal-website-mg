      <p>In this article we will see how to deploy a website with <b>AWS Lightsail</b>, and in the specific a WordPress
        website using macOS.</p>
      <p><b>AWS (Amazon Web Services) Lightsail</b> is a cloud computing service that you can use to host web
        applications and website. The technology provides the simplest way to manage Virtual Private Servers.
        This hosting service makes it simple for the users to deploy and operate WordPress websites, among others, for a
        fixed monthly price.</p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>To deploy your website you'll need:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An AWS Lightsail account;</li>
        <li>A domain name;</li>
        <li>A FTP such as <b>Cyberduck</b>;</li>
        <li>A database management application for working with MySQL databases such as <b>Sequel Pro</b> (on macOS).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h3>1 - Create a Lightsail instance</h3>

      <p>Once you sign up with Amazon Lightsail, you can create your lightsail instance. By clicking on <i>‘change AWS
          Region and Availability Zone’</i> you can select your favourite instance location.
        You will be prompted to select an Operating System platform. Linux works well for web servers unless you
        specifically want to use Microsoft technologies such as asp.net.</p>
      <p>On the <i>‘select a blueprint’</i>, you can choose an operating system only or an OS bundled with packages such
        as WordPress. An OS only blueprint is more flexible because it allows you to customize package installation. For
        the purpose of this article, we will select WordPress.</p>
      <p>Generate an SSH key by clicking on <i>‘Change SSH key pair’</i> and again on <i>‘Create New’</i>. Save it
        somewhere on your computer. There’s also the option to add a launch script that does things like add software,
        update software, or configure your instance in some other way.</p>
      <p>Towards the bottom of the screen, choose a plan for your instance, the $3.5 will work well, plus you’ll get one
        month for free. At this point, name your instance and click <i>‘Create’</i>. Your instance will be created and
        it will take a few seconds to switch from pending to running status.</p>

      <h3>2 - Create a static IP address</h3>

      <p>Up to this point, you only have an operating system on your instance. We need to attach an IP address to it so
        we can access the webpage on the browser. Go to networking and click on <i>‘Create static IP’</i>, here you need
        to select the instance you’ve created before. Give your IP a name or leave it as it is, then click
        <i>‘Create’</i>.</p>

      <h3>3 - Import your website archives with a FTP</h3>

      <p><b>Cyberduck</b> is a <i>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</i> used for the transfer of computer files between a
        client and server on a computer network. You can download it for free.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Cyberduck and click on <i>‘Open Connection’</i>. Select <i>‘SFTP (SSH file transfer protocol)’</i>;
        </li>
        <li>On the server section insert the static IP address that you have previously created on AWS;</li>
        <li>On the username you’ll need to insert <i>‘bitnami’</i>;</li>
        <li>Password: leave it empty;</li>
        <li>SSH private key: attach the one you created before;</li>
        <li>Click connect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A prompt message will show up saying <i>“Unknown fingerprint”</i>. This is because it’s the first time you
        connect to the server. A list of folders will show up. Go on <i>Apps -> WordPress -> htdocs</i>. What you’ll
        need to do now is to drag the content of <i>wp-content</i> of your WordPress website to the <i>wp-content</i> on
        Cyberduck.</p>


      <h3>4 - Create a database connection on Sequel Pro</h3>

      <p>While Cyberduck is transferring the files, open <b>Sequel Pro</b> and create a new connection by clicking on
        the <b>+</b> symbol on the left bottom of the application window. From the menu list on top select <i>SSH</i>
        and let’s see how to fill the requested fields:</p>
      <ul class="fields">
        <li><b>Name</b>: put the chosen name;</li>
        <li><b>MySQL host</b>: localhost;</li>
        <li>You can find the following details in the <i>wp_config.php</i> file that you can access from Cyberduck:</li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Username</b>: bn_wordpress;</li>
            <li><b>Password</b>: *find it in <i>wp_config.php</i> under MySQL database password*;</li>
            <li><b>Database</b>: bitnami_wordpress;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Port</b>: do not modify;</li>
        <li><b>SSH host</b>: public IP address from Lightsail instance;</li>
        <li><b>SSH user</b>: bitnami;</li>
        <li><b>SSH key</b>: insert your SSH key;</li>
        <li><b>SSH port</b>: 22.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now you’ll have to import the database that you have previously exported. Otherwise how is your website gonna
        show all the content you've updated on WordPress, duh?</p>
      <p>Finally, the last step to take is to synch the security salt. Download the <i>wp_config.php</i> file from
        Cyberduck. Now open the <i>wp_config.php</i> file in the WordPress folder of your website. In this file find the
        <i>‘Authentication Unique Keys and Salts’</i> and copy all the define keys. These lines need to replace the same
        lines of the <i>wp_config.php</i> file that you have previously downloaded from Cyberduck. Save the file and
        upload it again on Cyberduck replacing the old <i>wp_config.php</i></p>
      <p>Congratulations! You’ve deployed your WordPress website. </p>
