    <h1 id="post-title">Analysing Translation and Localization for Multilingual Website Projects</h1>
    <img class="hero-image" src="/images/multilingual.svg">
    <div id="post">
      <p>Gone are the days when you could simply translate your current website or digital media and instantly compete
        on the global market. Every business with an online presence has now the opportunity to be globally successful by
        localizing its online content.</p>

      <p>This process is called website localization and it's all about modifying an existing website to make it
        accessible, usable and culturally suitable to a target audience. Website localization is a multi-layered and
        delicate process needing both programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge. If either is missing,
        the chances are that a localization project will encounter problems.</p>

      <p>Website localization is more than mere translation. Translating only solves partial language problems while
        localization is the process of adapting a product or content to a specific locale or market. The process is
        therefore complex and involves three different levels of adaptation. </p>

      <p>First there's <b>translation</b>. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the
        language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to
        avoid cultural misunderstanding or offence. In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known. </p>

      <p>Second is the actual <b>localization</b>, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts
        and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and
        graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” Among the many technical
        elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and
        telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed. In order to ensure effective communication
        during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: information architecture,
        theme and navigation, graphics, photographs, audio, and visual. </p>

      <p>Third is <b>internationalization</b>, which involves making sure that the software being used is fully
        compatible with the technology of the country in question.</p>

      <p>There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The
        first is to focus on the demands of the user. The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to
        be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them. A second consideration is to
        take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is localization important?</h3>

      <p>The aim of localization is to give a product the look and feel of having been created specifically for a
        target market, no matter their language, culture, or location.</p>

      <p>Let's take companies such as Amazon, eBay, Google, and Facebook as examples. They all have taken advantage
        of the web’s global connectivity, and have emerged as ‘Global online Multinationals’. However, many more
        companies due to the lack of expertise or vision have not been able to leverage their online presence across
        global markets. </p>

      <p>The doctrine in the past decade was if you translate the website and digital media then they will come. But
        study after study has now shown that customers worldwide are not just looking for a website or digital media
        which is merely translated. The website or digital media needs to be well localized so as to resonate with
        its end user’s cultural and functional expectations. From a broad marketing perspective localization
        basically means adapting market offerings to best meet end user expectations. </p>

      <p>Do you want to expand your business globally? It's time for you to consider the benefits of cultural
        customization over basic translation.</p>
