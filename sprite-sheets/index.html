      <h2>What is a CSS Sprite?</h2>

      <p>CSS Sprite is a performance optimisation technique which consist of combining multiple images into a single
        image file called <i>Sprite Sheet</i>. To display a single image from the combined one, you could then use the
        CSS background-position property, defining the exact position of the image to be displayed.</p>
      <p>The advantage of using this method is the reduction of network congestion by limiting the number of downloads
        needed to render a web page. In fact, a web page with many images can take long time to load and generates
        multiple server requests. With Sprites, the number of HTTP requests will be significantly reduced resulting in
        overall site performance improvement.</p>
      <p>Let’s take an example. It’s common for websites to have multiple icons that change in style when the user
        hovers over them. When you place the mouse pointer over the browser icons in non-sprite version for the first
        time the hover image will appear after some time, causing an unwanted “flickering” effect. This happens because
        the hover image is loaded from the server on mouse hover, since the normal and hover images are two different
        images.
        Whereas in Sprite version, since all individual images are combined in a single one, the hover image is
        displayed immediately on mouse hover which results in smooth hover effect.</p>

      <h2>How do I create one?</h2>

      <p>Sprite images can be created with any image editing tool like Photoshop or Gimp to name a few.
        To create the Sprite Sheet just place all the single images side by side. Now you have a single image file
        containing all the images you need. Once the Sprite Sheet is ready, it’s time to use CSS to display just the
        part of an image sprite we need. Here there are a few properties that we can use: <b>width</b>, <b>height</b>,
        <b>background</b> (to reference the url of the sprite sheet), and <b>background-position</b>.</p>

      <h2>How to implement a sprite sheet</h2>

      <p>Suppose you have a cat icon and you want to add an hover state that turns the image dark, these are the two
        images you have:</p>

      <div class="cat-icons">
        <div class="single">
          <img class="cat" src="../images/cat-light.png" alt="A white cat face">
          <caption>Original state</caption>
        </div>
        <div class="single">
          <img class="cat" src="../images/cat-dark.png" alt="A black cat face">
          <caption>Hover state</caption>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Let's combine the two images side by side with photoshop:</p>

      <img class="sprite-sheet" src="../images/sprite-sheet.jpg" alt="A white cat face on side of a black cat face">

      <p>With HTML we have created a div element with class <mark>item</mark> and with CSS we set the background URL to
        reference the image file we have created:</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/martinagabrielli/2f8cd74df2c334af48747964fafce4d1.js"></script>

      <p>How this works is that the image on top is the image I want to display before hover. We use the
        background-position property with the 2-value syntax where the first value defines X and the second defines Y
        and we set both values to 0.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/martinagabrielli/934950eeffae336062a6055fcf865a97.js"></script>

      <p>Then on hover I want the image below to be displayed, so that’s why the background-position Y is set to -20px.
      </p>

      <p>Here's the final result. The hover effect works as expected and the browser only needs to load one image
        instead of two.</p>

      <div class="item"></div>

      <p>Of course this is a basic example, but just think about how much loading time you could save when dealing with
        large web pages. It's not by chance that companies like Amazon, Ebay and YouTube use this technique, it can
        really make the difference in user experience and site performance.</p>
